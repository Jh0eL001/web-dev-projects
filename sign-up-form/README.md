# Sign-Up Page Project

This is a sign-up page inspired by **World of Warcraft** factions. Users can select their faction (Horde or Alliance), and the background image will change accordingly. Additionally, there’s password validation to ensure both the "Password" and "Confirm Password" fields match.

## Features
- Responsive layout with **Flexbox**
- **Password Matching**: Alerts the user if the passwords don’t match.
- **Faction Selection**: Allows users to choose between **Horde** and **Alliance**, changing the background image dynamically.
